# Synesthesia
JavaScript project for the World Music Hackathon

*NOTE 2020* For GitHub Pages purposes, I've renamed "index.html" to "index_OLD.html"
and "all_in_one.html" to "index.html" because the page wasn't loading up all the files needed.
I'm assuming it had difficulty trying to link up all the files together.
So, I've decided to use the file that incorporated everything.

*OLD* I was able to run this on my MacOS using Anvil due to some "local server" warning.
However, I did make an "all_in_one.html" which shouldn't need any of that.
Just download everything, and double click on "all_in_one.html" and hopefully it works!

Note: This is far from being a final product, and it has a lot of bugs!
Given the time and being a one-man team, I had to rush it a bit.

Cheers!
