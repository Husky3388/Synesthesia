# Synesthesia
JavaScript project for the World Music Hackathon

I was able to run this on my MacOS using Anvil due to some "local server" warning.
However, I did make an "all_in_one.html" which shouldn't need any of that.
Just download everything, and double click on "all_in_one.html" and hopefully it works!

Note: This is far from being a final product, and it has a lot of bugs!
Given the time and being a one-man team, I had to rush it a bit.

Cheers!
